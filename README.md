# Robo-App

## About
A frontend-focused project using ReactJS and Redux, tachyons framework for styling; where users can find robots by name provided in the search field.
- *Tachyons* framework provides me with pre-designed CSS classes, it is similar to Bootstrap except it's more minimalistic which also means Tachyons comes in a smaller size but with that, of course, comes with less UI design options.
- I used *Redux-logger* middleware for the ease of debugging & following how Redux store is behaving as it provides me with detailed logs inside the browser's console.
